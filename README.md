# Open Data Studio

**Open Data Studio** is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to bring the best features of Azure Data Studio (ADS) into VS Code, purely as an open-source project.

Our goal is to provide a comprehensive SQL development experience directly within VS Code, focusing on performance, usability, and features that developers actually need.
